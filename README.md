# hello_world_5

another one to test Github

Repository and this README.md file created on Github.
README.md edited on Github (and committed).

Then this line was added locally (Ubuntu, and then "nano README.md"

After succesfully pushing back the updated file to the github repository, now editing this README.md file again on Github.
Let me see if I can then pull it again to local.

Now adding a line locally again to this file (Ubunto, nano....)
Before committing and pushing this, let me see if I can also create a Jupyter notebook here first.

----

Somewhat later, I have extended the Jupyter notebook.
Including reading from a .csv file (which is stored in the same project folder).

Let me now again commit and push to remote.

Now editing this file again directly on Github. Including some layouting such as *this text in italics* and **this text in bold**.
Also a list:

* bullet-point 1
* bullet-point 2

Let's see whether that does not go lost when pulling to local, updating it there, and then pushing back.

-----

This text is added locally using Marktext.

Here is code block:

`print ('hello world again')`

And now follows a Heading 3

### This is a heading 3

With some text including **bold** and *italic*. 

-----

This line is added in branch feature_1, directly on Github.

-----

This line is added in branch feature_2, directly on Github

This line is added in branch feature_2, locally in Ubuntu (nano editor)

This line is added via Marktext, while in Ubuntu branch feature_2 was checked out.
